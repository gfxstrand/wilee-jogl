# Wheatley: A Java Wayland compositor

This is the AWT/JOGL front-end to my wayland compositor.  This is not intended
for actual use, but as a tool for developing wheatley-core.  Because debugging
on a mobile platform is difficult (even with the emulator), this project allows
for much easier wheatley testing and development.

Right now the code is in a very early stage and is not fit for use.  The
purpose of this repository is to let the rest of the Wayland community see what
I'm doing and to get feedback.
